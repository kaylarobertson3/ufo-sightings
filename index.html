              The number of reported sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects in
              the United States is growing every year. Is extra terrestrial life
              scoping out our planet? Or are these all reasonably identified as
              “unidentified”?

            The truth is out there – as is the data. Between 1910 and 2013,
            there were more than 65,000 UFO sightings reported to the
            <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/"
              >National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)</a
            >, an organization that collects and investigates UFO sightings.
            What used to be commonly associated with flying saucers is now
            generally associated with flashes and beams of light. But as long as
            these flying objects remain unidentifiable, programs like the
            Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (discontinued in
            2012), the research division of Space Force (initiated in 2019) and
            NUFORC have funding.

            Data for this project spans 1910 and 2013, including only sightings

              <p>
                Of the 65,114 UFO sightings in the US between January 1910 and
                December 2013, unsurprisingly, not many sightings happen when
                the sun is out. Most sightings happen at night, when the
                mysterious objects’ lights can be seen. Hover over a circle to
                find out how many UFO sightings occurred on a certain weekday
                and time.

              <h1>Late, weekend nights</h1>
              <p>
                Most sightings happen around the end of the workweek, between
                19:00 and 23:00. Many reports mention “stepping outside for a
                cigarette”, while others describe spotting UFOS while inside a
                vehicle. The most common day for UFO spotting is Saturday, with
                Friday at a close second. The best time for UFO sightings is 9pm
                or 10pm.

                Montana also boasts a high sighting rate by population, possibly

                described as looking like "light". 13.47 percent appear as
                "round" or "circular", and 10.63 percent appear triangle-like.

                Most UFO sightings happen in summer and fall, possibly due to
                spending more time outside. The month that holds the most UFO
                sightings is July.

                Out of 7,639 total July sightings from 1910 to 2013, 1,083
                happened on July 4th. Whether this is due to people
                misinterpreting fireworks for UFOS, or simply more people
                outside at night, looking at the sky, July 4th stands as the
                most common day to spot a UFO.

            From the National UFO Reporting Center. While the NUFOC keeps
            international records, I filtered by the U.S for this project due to
            most being U.S.-based, and for clarity. Map population data from the
            United States Census. Made during a dataviz portion of the academy
            program at Infographics Group, with the help of D3, d3-legend and
            d3-annotations. Fonts from VTF and Google Fonts.
