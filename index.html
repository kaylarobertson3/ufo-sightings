          Is it a bird? Or a plane? If it isn’t not clear, it’s an unidentified flying object.
          Between 1910 and 2013, there were over 65,000 reports* of Unidentified Flying Object sightings in the United
          States, according to the <a href="http://www.nuforc.org/">National UFO Reporting
            Center (NURC)</a>, an organization that collects and investigates UFO sightings.
          <p>
            <br />
            Despite <a
              href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/21/what-is-behind-the-decline-in-ufo-sightings">reports
              that UFO sightings are dwindling</a>, the U.S. government hasn't stopped from dedicating funds and
            research to the phenomenon. The Pentagon's top-secret UFO
            research office, the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program began in 2007 and ended in 2012, but
            not before going through <a
              href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html">$22 million in
              funding</a>. It came to public attention following a New York Times investigation into the organization
            in 2017. While the Defense Intelligence Agency has since released <a
              href="https://fas.org/irp/dia/aatip-list.pdf">38 research titles</a> about their findings, part of the
            data remains classified.
            <p>
              <br />
              The once-secret organization isn't the only way the United States shows interest in extraterrestrial
              research.
              In February 2019, President Trump signed into effect the U.S. Space Force, a national security entity and

              space warfare service. While the Space Force isn't primarily for UFO research, it's the first time the
              military has
              had a dedicated space sector in the United States, continuing a history of the United States' government
              taking
              interest in matters beyond our atmosphere.
              Two months later, the U.S. Navy announced that they've had an increase of UFO sightings, and drafted new
              guidelines for officially reporting UFOs, <a
                href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/23/us-navy-guidelines-reporting-ufos-1375290">Politico
                reports</a>. While this doesn't mean the Navy is suddenly concerned about aliens, it puts into place a
              more formal
              reporting process so no unknown sightings slip through the cracks, a former Pentagon
              intelligence officer told Politico.
              <p>
                <br />
                "There have been a number of reports of unauthorized and/or unidentified aircraft entering various
                military-controlled ranges and designated air space in recent years," the Navy said in
                response to questions from POLITICO. "For safety and security concerns, the Navy and the [U.S. Air
                Force] takes these reports very seriously and investigates each and every report." As the U.S prepares
                for shifts in the way space and UFOs are studied, scroll down to look back at nearly 100 years
                of NUFORC UFO reports to understand what they tell us about what we see in the night sky.

            <h1>UFO sightings by weekday and time</h1>
            <p>
              Of the 65,114 UFO sightings in the US between January 1910 and
              December 2013, unsurprisingly, not many sightings happen when the
              sun is out. Most sightings happen at night, when the mysterious
              objects’ lights can be seen. Hover over a circle to
              find out how many UFO sightings occurred on a certain weekday
              and time.

            <h1>Late, weekend nights</h1>
            <p>
              Most sightings happen around the end of the workweek, between
              19:00 and 23:00. Many reports mention “stepping outside for a
              cigarette”, while others describe spotting UFOS while inside a
              vehicle. The most common day for UFO spotting is Saturday, with Friday at a close second. The best time
              for UFO sightings is 9pm or 10pm.

              Montana also boasts a high sighting rate by population, possibly
              due to its large size and many rural, wooded areas. Hover over a

              According to NURC reports, 21.2 percent of UFO sightings are described as
              looking like "light". 13.47 percent appear as "round" or "circular", and 10.63 percent appear
              triangle-like.

              Most UFO sightings happen in summer and fall, possibly due to spending more time outside. The month that
              holds the most UFO sightings is July.

            <p>Out of 7,639 total July sightings from 1910 to 2013, 1,083 happened on July 4th. Whether this is due to
              people misinterpreting fireworks for UFOS, or simply more people
              outside at night, looking at the sky, July 4th stands as the most common day to spot a UFO.</p>
